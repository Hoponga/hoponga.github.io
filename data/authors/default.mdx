My name is Kailash, and I'm currently studying EECS @ UC Berkeley. I'm interested in: 
* condensed matter theory 
* probability theory and analysis 
* AI + Science (neural operators, diffusion models)
* Efficient ml /hardware acceleration
* Playing/watching sports (playing: running/biking/tennis; watching: soccer/running/MMA/tennis)

...among many many other things. I also very much enjoy good books, though perhaps others may disagree with my definition of good.
